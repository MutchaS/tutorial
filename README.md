Git Workflow Tutorial
========

This is a public git repository that developers can use to follow along with the
exercises in the book, "Git Workflow, a tutorial and guide".

The book will lead you through forking this repository, branching, making
changes, committing, rebasing and eventually submitting a pull request.  

The last part of the tutorial is adding your name, the date, and a comment to 
the names.txt file as a nice log of who has completed this tutorial.
